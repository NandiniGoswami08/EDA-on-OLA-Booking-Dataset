# EDA-on-OLA-Booking-Dataset
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis on an Ola booking dataset using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to clean, transform, and visualize the data to extract meaningful insights about ride bookings, trends, and patterns.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about Ola ride bookings, including details like ride distance, booking value, payment method, booking status, vehicle type, and ride timestamps.

# Steps in the Project

## 1 Data Cleaning & Transformation

- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.

- Converted categorical columns (like Payment Method, Vehicle Type) into proper formats.

- Fixed incorrect data types.

- Removed duplicate entries if found.

- Handled outliers in numerical columns like Ride Distance & Booking Value for better analysis.


## 2 Data Visualization (Key Insights)

- Booking Trends Over Time → Used bar plots and line plots to see daily and hourly ride trends.

- Ride Distance vs. Booking Value → Used scatter plots & hexbin plots to understand the relationship.

- Booking Status Distribution → Used pie charts to show completed, canceled, and pending bookings.

- Most Popular Vehicle Types → Used bar charts to show the demand for different vehicles.

- Heatmap for Correlation Analysis → Used a correlation matrix to find relationships between numerical variables.
